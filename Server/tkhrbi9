When reading from a socket, it can be difficult to know when the end of the incoming data has been reached. This is because the data may be sent in multiple packets or chunks, and there is no guarantee that all of the data will arrive at once.

To handle this situation, protocols like TCP typically use a stream-based approach to data transmission, where data is transmitted as a continuous stream of bytes rather than discrete packets. The receiving program must then use some method of delimiting the data to determine where one message ends and the next begins.

There are several ways to delimit data when reading from a socket:

Length prefix: The sender can include a length prefix at the beginning of the message, indicating how many bytes are in the message. The receiver can then read the prefix, allocate a buffer of the appropriate size, and read the remaining data into the buffer.

Delimiter: The sender can include a special character or sequence of characters at the end of the message to indicate the end of the message. The receiver can then read data from the socket until the delimiter is encountered.

Message framing: The sender can frame each message with a header and a footer, indicating the start and end of the message. The receiver can then read the header to determine the size of the message, allocate a buffer, read the message data into the buffer, and then read the footer to confirm the end of the message.

In some cases, it may not be possible to determine the end of the data stream, such as when reading a continuous data feed from a sensor. In these cases, the receiving program may need to use timeouts or other heuristics to detect the end of the data stream.
